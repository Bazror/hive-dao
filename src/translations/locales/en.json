        "faqQuestion1": "What is a Steem Worker Proposal System?",
        "faqAnswer1": "A worker proposal system allows Steem users to publicly propose work that they are willing to do in exchange for pay. Steem users can then vote on these proposals in almost the same way they vote for witnesses (stake weighted votes, but voters can vote for as many proposals as they want). The proposals that get a sufficient amount of vote weight get funded from a special Steem account controlled by the blockchain.",
        "faqQuestion2": "Where does the funding come from?",
        "faqAnswer2": "The funding is generated from an extra inflation that was established during the hardfork 21, during which 10% of all newly generated tokens are going to steem.dao account.",
        "faqQuestion3": "Is it free to submit a proposal?",
        "faqAnswer3": "There's a 10 SBD fee that is charged before you submit a proposal. This prevents spamming and creation of projects with no value.",
        "faqQuestion4": "What is a Steem Blockchain?",
        "faqAnswer4": "Steem is a social blockchain that grows communities and makes immediate revenue streams possible for users by rewarding them for sharing content. It’s currently the only blockchain that can power real applications via social apps like Steemit.",
        "faqQuestion5": "What is steemit.com?",
        "faqAnswer5": "Steemit has redefined social media by building a living, breathing, and growing social economy - a community where users are rewarded for sharing their voice. It's a new kind of attention economy. Steemit.com is one of the many websites (including Busy.org, DTube, and Utopian.io) that are powered by the Steem blockchain and STEEM cryptocurrency."
